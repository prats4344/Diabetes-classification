# 🩺 Diabetes-classification
A supervised machine learning project built with Python to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not. This model uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and is trained on the well-known Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from Kaggle.

✅ Project Focus: Data preprocessing, standardization, model training, and evaluation using accuracy metrics.
